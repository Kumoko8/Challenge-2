# Personal-Portfolio

# Description
This repository contains the files for Challenge week 2 of UT Bootcamp. This project was purposed to use media queries and flexboxes to increase the responsiveness of webpages on different sized devices. Also to increase the ease of navigation on a page using local links. In addition, we used our knowledge of html and CSS to style a webpage. I learned a lot about applying these styles in CSS and making your html and CSS mesh well. The webpage also serves as a foundation to showcase my work to future employers.

# How to Use
Use this webpage as a template or design inspiration for what your portfolio could look like! Click on the links in the header to navigate to each section of the website. Use the links to navigate to different work samples.
